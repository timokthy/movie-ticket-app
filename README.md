**Authors:** Timothy Mok, Bao-Khoi Nguyen, Okeoghenemarho Obuareghe, Tobi Odufeso

## Summary
The objective of this project was to create an application to purchase movie tickets. Tickets could be purchased as a guest or as a member. The main menu of this GUI-based application allows users to purchase tickets, view their tickets, or manage their membership. Within the purchase tickets menu, users can choose a date, movie, and seat number before proceeding to payment. Verification of payments was not required as part of the project and was thus not developed in the backend. The application is designed to be used by customers, therfore an interface that is as user-friendly as possible was developed.

The frontend of the web application was developed using Swing. In the backend, Java was used with the Spring framework to create API endpoints in order to obtain data from the MySQL database.
